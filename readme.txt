This is a synthesizer with the audio guts borrowed from the MeeBlip. I also added a 8/16 step sequencer that is tied directly into the MeeBlip circuit.

The code for the Atmega32 can be found here: https://github.com/MeeBlip/meeblip-synth
The code for the Atmega328 can be found here: http://www.roebbeling.de/wordpress/?p=85
